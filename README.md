# Multimodal generative representations

Implement baselines for multimodal generative representations.

Currently uses Arora et al's baseline representations for sentences,
and updates them further to represent audio-visual features.

Currently only loads MOSI data.

# Instructions
To run: `python simplesif.py`

Currently requires (Arora et al's SIF implementation)[https://github.com/PrincetonML/SIF].
Currently requires Python 2 (because of the SIF implementation)
